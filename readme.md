Across residential, commercial, and civil environments, I’ve learned to:

- Coordinate crews and equipment  
- Maintain a safe jobsite  
- Document daily production and progress  
- Follow plans, procedures, and specifications  
- Communicate delays, scope issues, and change orders  
- Operate under pressure and tight timelines  

These strengths now support both **construction leadership** and my growing skills in **construction management and digital operations**.
